# utfe

## Universal Tool For Everything -- a small bot

This bot is written mostly in perl.  Most of the features require some
external data to be downloaded and parsed into the correct format.
Check the `URLs` file in each subdirectory for pointers to data
sources.

### Usage

utfe.bot is intended to be run by some bot framework like
[3ma-bot](https://github.com/Sec42/3ma-bot).

Each feature is currently implemented as a standalone binary in a subdirectory.

### Licence

All code in this repo is herby licenced under the 2-clause BSD licence. 

### Legacy

Most of the features are ports of features of the `Counter` - an old IRC bot.

### Thanks

Thanks to all members of #blafasel who suggested and tested features.
